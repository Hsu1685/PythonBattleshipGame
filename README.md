### Game options
###### Option 1: Duo player mode
1. Player 1 has to place his ships.
2. Player 2 has to place his ships.
3. Shoot and switch each turn until someone runs out of ships.

###### Option 2: Single player mode
1. Place your own ships.
2. The computer places its ships immediately.
3. As soon as you have shot, the computer shoots and you are immediately back on turn.
